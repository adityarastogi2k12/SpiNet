# SpiNet
This repository contains the official implementation for SpiNet: A Deep Neural Network for Schatten p-norm Regularized Medical Image Reconstruction

## Training Data

The training data for SpiNet consists of brain scans of four patients and 360 images in total. The testing data consists of 164 images from one patients.

Hemant et al. <a href="#modl">[1]</a>. have released the parallel imaging dataset used in their MoDL paper <a href="#modl">[1]</a>. You can download the full dataset from the below link:
